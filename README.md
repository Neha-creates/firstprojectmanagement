## Overview
<p>Using github's project management features like milestones, issues, project boards for the first time is interesting.</p>
<p>These features can improve a team collaboration and make it more interactive, like raising and resolving issue is like a chat between the manager and the developer or the team member.</p>
<p>Also it can improve project organization because it is giving project management tool in the github, so no need to go to any other app or website for project management tools.</p>
<p>I am using this for the first time and my experience with this was quite good. If you don't know about these things/tools just go and check once and you can use them by the given instruction their.</p>
### Milestone and issues:
<p>Milestone is like small and achievable goals that are important also. Creating milestones in the project is like breaking down the project into small pieces for better understanding and make it achievable.</p>
<p>Raising issue in milestone is like giving more precise way to do the steps to achieve that milestone.</p>
### Projects:
<p>This is like Trello inside the github. So this is basically board for managing project tasks.</p>
<p>In projects section we can make our own private project and can handle it according our requirements.</p>
<p>We can make different lists and columns to align tasks and manage them by drag and drop feature.</p>
