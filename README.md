## Overview
<p>Using github's project management features like milestones, issues, project boards for the first time is interesting.</p>
<p>These features can improve a team collaboration and make it more interactive, like raising and reloving issue is like a chat between the manager and the developer or the team member.</p>
<p>Also it can improve project organization because it is giving project management tool in the github, so no need to go to any other app or website for project management tools.</p>
<p>I am using this for the first time and my experience with this was quite good. If you don't know about these things/tools just go and check once and you can use them by the given instruction their.</p>
